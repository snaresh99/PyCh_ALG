    "CUDA enables developers to speed up compute intensive applications by offloading complex tasks from the CPU to the GPU. This is possible because GPUs have many more cores than CPUs, which are designed to perform tasks sequentially.\n",
    "- CUDA allows developers to run tasks in parallel on the GPU, which can significantly increase computing performance.\n",
