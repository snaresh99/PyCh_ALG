import PyDAQmx

# Create a task
task = PyDAQmx.Task()

# Add an analog input voltage channel
task.CreateAIVoltageChan("Dev1/ai0", "", PyDAQmx.DAQmx_Val_Cfg_Default, -10.0, 10.0, PyDAQmx.DAQmx_Val_Volts, None)

# Start the task
task.StartTask()

# Read a single sample
data = PyDAQmx.float64()
task.ReadAnalogScalarF64(10.0, PyDAQmx.byref(data), None)

# Stop the task
task.StopTask()

# Print the data
print(data.value)
Explanation
Import PyDAQmx: Import the necessary PyDAQmx library to interact with your National Instruments data acquisition device.
Create a Task: Create a task object, which represents a collection of operations that will be performed on your DAQ device.
Add an AI Voltage Channel: Use the CreateAIVoltageChan method to add an analog input voltage channel to your task. Provide the following arguments:
Physical Channel: The physical channel name on your DAQ device (e.g., "Dev1/ai0").
Name: An optional name for the channel within your task.
Terminal Configuration: Specify how the channel's input signal is referenced (e.g., DAQmx_Val_Cfg_Default for default configuration).
Minimum Value: The minimum voltage value that can be measured on the channel.
Maximum Value: The maximum voltage value that can be measured on the channel.
Units: The units of the measured voltage (e.g., DAQmx_Val_Volts for volts).
Custom Scale Name: An optional name for a custom scale to apply to the channel.
Start the Task: Start the task to begin data acquisition.
Read Data: Use the ReadAnalogScalarF64 method to read a single voltage value from the channel.
Stop the Task: Stop the task to halt data acquisition.
Print the Data: Print the acquired voltage value.
