    "4. Make the Connection\n",
    "Step-by-Step Wiring\n",
    "Power Off Both Devices: Always ensure that both the Raspberry Pi and NI DAQ are powered off before making connections to avoid damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Connect GPIO Pin to DAQ:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a jumper wire to connect GPIO17 (on the Raspberry Pi) to the chosen digital input channel on the NI DAQ (e.g., Dev1/port0/line0).\n",
    "Connect Ground:\n",
    "\n",
    "Connect a ground (GND) pin from the Raspberry Pi to the ground terminal of the NI DAQ. This is crucial for a common reference voltage between the two devices.\n",
    "Example Connections\n",
    "Raspberry Pi:\n",
    "\n",
    "GPIO17: This is the output pin you will control with your code.\n",
    "GND: Any GND pin on the Raspberry Pi.\n",
    "NI DAQ:\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital Input (e.g., Dev1/port0/line0): This is the input channel where the GPIO signal is received.\n",
    "GND: The GND terminal on the NI DAQ.\n",
    "5. Testing the Connection\n",
    "Power On Both Devices: After wiring, power on both the Raspberry Pi and the NI DAQ.\n",
    "Run the Raspberry Pi Code: Execute the code that toggles GPIO17 between high and low.\n",
    "Run the NI DAQ Code: Use the NI-DAQmx code to read the digital input channel where GPIO17 is connected.\n",
    "Important Considerations\n",
    "Voltage Levels: Ensure that the voltage levels are compatible. The Raspberry Pi typically outputs 3.3V when a GPIO pin is high, which is acceptable for the NI DAQ.\n",
    "Debouncing: If you're using this setup for button presses or similar applications, consider debouncing the signal in software to avoid false readings.\n",
    "Isolation: In critical applications, consider using opto-isolators to protect the Raspberry Pi from any potential voltage spikes from the NI DAQ.\n",
    "By following these steps, you'll have a working connection between the Raspberry Pi's GPIO and the NI DAQ, allowing you to send digital signals effectively! If you have any questions or need further clarification, just let me know!\n"
