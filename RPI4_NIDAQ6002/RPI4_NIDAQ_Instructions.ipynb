    "ChatGPT\n",
    "Simulating a GPIO pin on a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B and connecting it to a National Instruments (NI) DAQ 6002 involves a few steps. Here's a general approach you can take:\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements\n",
    "Hardware:\n",
    "\n",
    "Raspberry Pi 4 Model B\n",
    "NI DAQ 6002\n",
    "Jumper wires or suitable connectors\n",
    "Software:\n",
    "\n",
    "Raspberry Pi OS (or another compatible OS)\n",
    "Python (with GPIO library)\n",
    "NI-DAQmx drivers (for your OS)\n",
    "NI-DAQmx Python wrapper (like nidaqmx)\n",
    "Steps\n",
    "1. Set Up the Raspberry Pi\n",
    "Install the GPIO Library: Ensure you have the RPi.GPIO library installed on your Raspberry Pi. You can install it using:\n",
    "bash\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "sudo apt-get update\n",
    "sudo apt-get install python3-rpi.gpio\n",
    "2. Wiring\n",
    "Connect the Raspberry Pi GPIO to NI DAQ:\n",
    "Choose a GPIO pin on the Raspberry Pi (e.g., GPIO17).\n",
    "Connect this pin to a digital input channel on the NI DAQ 6002.\n",
    "Make sure to connect the ground (GND) of the Raspberry Pi to the ground of the DAQ.\n",
    "3. Configure the NI DAQ\n",
    "Install NI-DAQmx: Make sure that you have the NI-DAQmx drivers installed. You may need to refer to the NI website for specific installation instructions for your operating system.\n",
    "4. Writing the Code\n",
    "You can create a simple Python script to control the GPIO pin and simulate the input on the NI DAQ.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an example code snippet that toggles a GPIO pin:\n",

    "        print(\"GPIO Pin HIGH\")\n",
    "        time.sleep(1)                      # Wait for 1 second\n",
    "        GPIO.output(gpio_pin, GPIO.LOW)   # Set pin low\n",
    "        print(\"GPIO Pin LOW\")\n",
