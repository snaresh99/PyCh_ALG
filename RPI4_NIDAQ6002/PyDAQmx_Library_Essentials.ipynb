Description: PyDAQmx is a python wrapper for NI DAQmx, a C API (Application programming interface with NI data acquisition hardware).
- This library simplifies interaction with DAQ hardware, enabling the use of Python for measurement and control applications.

Key Features of PyDAQmx:
* Direct C API access: PyDAQmx allows direct access to all DAQmx functions.
* Convenient python interface: It provides some pythonic convenience wrappers, like using callbacks for event based data acquisition.
* Integration with Numpy: Data acuquisition often integrate well with NumPy, which is useful for handling and processing large data sets efficiently.
