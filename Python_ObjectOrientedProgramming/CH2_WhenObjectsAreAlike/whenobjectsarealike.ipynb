    "# What does !r meaning \n",
    "n Python, self.name!r is an expression that involves formatted string literals (also known as f-strings) and the !r conversion flag. Let's break it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. self.name\n",
    "self refers to the current instance of the class.\n",
    "name is an attribute of the instance, which presumably stores a value (like a string) that represents a name.\n",
    "So, self.name accesses the name attribute of the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. !r (The !r Conversion Flag)\n",
    "The !r is used within an f-string to convert the value to its official string representation (using the repr() function). The repr() function returns a string that provides a more \"formal\" or \"developer-friendly\" representation of an object, often including special characters or quotation marks around strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a string self.name, using !r will call repr(self.name), which typically adds quotes around the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "If self.name is \"Alice\", repr(self.name) would return \"'Alice'\" (with single quotes around the string).\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __repr__(self):\n",
    "        return f\"Person(name={self.name!r})\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a Person object\n",
    "person = Person(\"Alice\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the object\n",
    "print(person)  # Output: Person(name='Alice')\n",
    "Detailed Breakdown:\n",
    "self.name: Accesses the name attribute of the Person instance.\n",
    "!r: Calls repr(self.name), which returns the official string representation of self.name, adding quotes around it.\n",
    "Output of !r:\n",
    "If self.name = \"Alice\", then self.name!r results in \"'Alice'\" (a string with quotes around it).\n",
    "This is useful for debugging or when you want to show the \"raw\" form of a value, particularly when dealing with strings or complex objects.\n",
    "When to Use !r:\n",
    "You would typically use !r when:\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to ensure that the string representation includes quotes (e.g., when logging or debugging).\n",
    "You want to use the repr() representation of an object, especially for debugging or logging purposes.\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "self.name!r formats self.name using repr(), which provides a more \"formal\" string representation, often with quotes."
