    "# Absolute Imports:\n",
    "* Absolute imorts specify the complete path to the module, function, or path we want to import. \n",
    "* If we need access to Product class inside products module, we could use any of these syntaxes to do an absolute import.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* So, with these choices, which syntax do we choose?\n",
    "- It depends on your personal taste and the application at hand.\n",
    "- if there are dozens of classes and functions inside, the product module that i want to use, i generally import the module name using the\n",

    "\n",
    "* Packages can also be installed to the python site packages folder, or the PYTHONPATH environment variable could be customized to dynamically tell python what folders to search for packages and modules it is going to import.\n",
    "\n",
    "Author recommends the following:\n",
    "* from ecommerce import products syntax, and then access the individual classes using products.Product.\n",
    "* If only need one or two classes fromthe products module, I can import them directly using the from ecommerce.products import Product.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Relative Imports:\n",
    "\n",
    "* When working with related modules in a package, it seems kind of silly to specify the full path, we know what our parent module is named.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is where relative imports come in. Relative imports are basically a way of saying find a class, funciton, or module as it is positioned relative to the current module.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If we are working in the products module and we want to import the database class from the database modlue next to it, we could use relative import.\n",
    "\n",
    "form .database import Database\n",
    "\n",
    "* the period in front of database says \"use the database module inside the current package\". In this case, the current package is the package containing the products.py file we are currently editing, that is, the ecommerce package.\n",
    "\n",
    "* if we are editing the paypal module inside the ecommerce.payments package, we would want to say \" use the database package inside the parent package\" instead. This is easily done with two periods, as shown here.\n",
    "\n",
    "from ..database import Database\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use more periods to go further up the hierarchy. Ofcourse, we can also go down one side and back up the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "ecommerce.contact package containing an email module snd wanted to import the send_mail function into our paypal module.\n",
    "\n",
    "from ..contact.email import send_email\n",
    "\n",
    "The import uses two periods to say, the parent of the payments package, and then uses the normal package.module syntax to go back up into the contact package.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Finally, we can import code directly from packages, as opposed to just modules inside packages. In this example, we ehave an ecommerce package containing two modules named database.py and products.py. The database module contains a db variable that is accessed from a lot of places. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The database module contains a db variable that is accessed from a lot of places. Wouldn't it be convenient if this could be imported as:\n",
    "\n",
    "import ecommerce.db instead of import ecommerce.database.db?\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the __init__.py file that defines a directory as a package? this file can contain any vairable or class declarations we like, and they will be available as part of the package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "if the ecommerce/__init__.py file contained this line:\n",
    "\n",
    "from .database import db\n",
    "\n",
    "we can then access the db attribute from main.py or any other file using this import.\n",
    "\n",
    "from ecommerce import db\n",
    "\n",
    "it might help to think of the  __init__.py file as if it was an ecommerce.py file if that file were a module instead of a package. This can also be useful if you put all your code in a single module and later decide to break it up into a package of modules.\n",
    "* The __init__.py file for the new package can still be the main point of contact for other modules talking to it, but the code can be inernally organized into several differnt modules or subpackages.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Recommendation: Do not put all your code in an __init__.py file, though. Programmers do not expect actual logic to happen in this file, and much like with from x import *, it can trip them up if they are looking for the declaration of a particular piece of code and can't find it until they check __init__.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Don't Do This: from database import * \n",
    "1. most experienced Python programmers will tell you that you should never use this syntax ( from database import *)\n",
    "* a few will tell you there are some very specific situations wher it is useful, but we can disagree\n",
    "* one way to learn why to avoid this syntax is touse it and try to understand your code two years later. We can save some time and two years of poorly written code with a quick explanation now!\n",
    "\n",
    "# We've got several reasons for avoiding this: from database import *\n",
    "\n",
    "* When we explicily import the database class at the top of our file using database import Database, we can easily see where the database class comes from.\n",
    "* We might use db = Database() 400 lines later in the file, and we can quickly look at the imports to see where that Database class came from.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Then, if we need clarification as to how to use the Database class, we can visit the original file( or import the module in the interactive interpreter and use the help database.Database command).\n",
    "* However, if we use the from database import * syntax, it takes a lot longer to find where that class is located. Code maintenance becomes a nightmare.\n",
    "\n",
    "* if ther are conflicting names, we're doomed. Let's say we have two modules both of thiwh provide a class named Database. Using from module_1 import * and from module_2 import * means the second import statement overwrites the database name created by the first import. if we use import module_1 and import module_2, ew'd use the module names as qualifiers to disambiguate module_1.Database from module_2.Database.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In addition, mose code editors are able to provide extra functionality, such as reliable code completion, the ability to jump to the definition of a class, or inline documentation, if normal imports are used. The import * syntax can hamper their ability to do this reliably.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Finally, using the import * syntax can bring unexpected objects into your local namespace. Sure,it will import allthe classes and functions defined in the module being imported from, but unless a special__all__ list is provided in the module, this import will also import any classes or modules that were themselves imported into that file.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Important Note on  above topic\n",
    "* Every name used in amodule should come from a well-specified place, whether it is defined in that module, or explicitly imported from another module. There should be no magic variables that seem to come out of thin air. We should always be able to immediately identify where the names in our current namespace originated. \n",
